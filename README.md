# Post Quantum Cryptography - Scala #

A small library for use within the Simex messaging protocol (SEP) client and server.

See [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) for more information.
The aim of this project is to provide a set of key-based encryption and hashing functions that can be used in SEP clients and servers that are deemed secure against both quantum and classical computers.
